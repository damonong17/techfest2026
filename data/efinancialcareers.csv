"Consulting, Cyber Operational Technology, Graduate Associate 2026",KPMG,Singapore,Posted 7 days ago,,Permanent,Competitive,"Job Description  At KPMG, your long-term future is every bit as important to us as it is to you. That's why our aim is to give you experiences that will stay with you for a lifetime. Whether it's great training and development, working across functional sectors, mobility opportunities or corporate responsibility volunteering activities - you'll gain a wealth of experiences on which to build a rewarding career. We're proud of our culture - it's one that recognises hard work, encourages new ways of thinking and embraces diversity and inclusion. We have an innovative spirit which inspires what we do and how we do it - striving to be better lies at the heart of who we are.  Technology underpins many of the most influential organisations in the world and presents opportunities for businesses that want to seek out new markets and are prepared to invest in transformational change. The last ten years have seen a rapid emergence of new technology, greater connectivity for organisations and individuals, and a 24/7 approach to global commerce. However, this has left many organisations behind the curve and struggling to achieve their business aspirations without feeling exposed to risks. We believe that by turning traditional thinking on its head, adopting a positive approach to managing risk, will set organisations free to achieve their business aspirations.  KPMG Cybersecurity professionals assist clients to address their concerns around Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Privacy of their technology, business systems, and information assets. Using a holistic view of how Technology and Business integrate, the Cyber team performs technology-risk focused assessments, technology compliance, IT/operational process reviews, and design of information risk & cyber security solutions.   We are looking for candidates to join a growing team to assist clients in the following area:  Cybersecurity in Operational Technology (OT) is a challenging but fulfilling field. One challenging aspect of this field is that it sits in intersection of two disciplines that usually do not intersect. Cybersecurity has its origins in Information Technology (IT), while OT system and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are used by engineers to control and monitor physical processes. Professionals with expertise in both disciplines are rare. OT security is also a fulfilling field because we have been tasked by our clients to solve a broad range of issues including regulatory compliance, cyber risk assessments, penetration testing, red teaming, incident response and more.
