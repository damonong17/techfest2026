On Hypotenuse AI, brands can store their product data, and have AI agents fill in missing details, edit their product images and write their content. Hypotenuse AI is impacting the entire ecommerce industry globally, with customers ranging from brands like Billabong and Crunchyroll to some of the largest department stores in US and Canada. We’re backed by top global investors like Y Combinator, January Capital and executives from Amazon, Shopback and other VCs/angels, and have an experienced team of hard-hitters with a background in AI research, ecommerce and top startups. Join us if you want to be part of the journey as we build a generational company reshaping AI & ecommerce! The role We’re looking for an experienced full stack engineer to join us as we scale and reshape how ecommerce brands work. We handle large amounts of data (millions of product records per customer), across many brands, and are constantly onboarding new customers fast—scaling up what we do is a key priority in this role. We don’t want code monkeys. In this role, you’ll be extremely hands on, spending the bulk of time rapidly building features, fixes and improvements, while working on a high level: scaling infra, architecting/designing new components and thinking about the product. Here are some examples of the types of problems that teammates in this role work on: designing and implementing a new image generation workflow and feature from start to end orchestrating and engineering context around AI models/LLMs to maximize performance (output quality, speed and reliability) optimizing database queries or frontend components to reduce generation time from X to Y rapidly shipping and iterating on new and core features scaling up our infrastructure to be able to handle high concurrency, high volume asynchronous jobs so it can handle a load of X in Y time influencing our current engineering practices and constantly improving them to increase dev speed, reduce bugs, improve code practices etc. You’ll work on features and applications that push the frontier of what’s possible today, setting the groundwork and solving problems from first principles to reshape how ecommerce brands work as an industry. To achieve that level of impact, we work intensely and move fast. Expect new features every few days. Expect hard work, long hours. Expect to build things that no one has done before. We thrive on speed and precision, coupled with a whole lot of new technology. Sound like you? We want engineers who can thrive in a startup; able to work in an extremely fast-paced environment, and can truly drive building features from scratch. We’re looking for engineers who: Own things end-to-end: we’re a startup. You aren’t here to just receive instructions. We want you to be a thinker and driver. Play a part in figuring out the features to build, the architecting of it, and driving it all the way to customer impact. Obsess over problems: if you love to dig deep into architecture and scaling issues, optimize queries, figuring out tricky bugs; if you obsess and have a constant curiosity to dig deep and learn, then we are your tribe. Are product minded: you think beyond just code. You understand the customer, problem statements, and are able to drive impact on a product-level. Bonus if you love interacting directly with users. Not all of the following are strict requirements, but experience and a strong foundation will help a long way: You've designed and built backend architectures (i.e. experience with AWS, designing APIs, components, database optimizations etc..), often needing to handle large amounts of data and concurrent or asynchronous jobs You're familiar with software engineering best practices (testing, logging/monitoring, deployments, event tracking etc..) and have worked with large codebases before Interest in AI (experience in AI and training AI models isn’t a requirement—you’ll learn a lot about that from our team here, but it is a bonus, and you need to have a strong interest and inclination for it) We're hiring across all experience levels — from fresh graduates to junior, senior, and lead software engineers.

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more. The Role Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organisations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer Intern, you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Foundry, or Palantir Apollo: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organisation is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. Core Responsibilities As a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties. SWE principles include: • Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter. • Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems. • Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team. Technologies We Use It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university TA, switched to CS recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use: • Varying languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend • Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, Elasticsearch, React, and Redux • Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub What We Value Ability to communicate and collaborate with a variety of individuals, including engineers, users and non-technical team members. Willingness to learn and make decisions independently, and the ability to ask questions when needed. What We Require Engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics. Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. Experience coding in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. Must be planning on graduating in 2027. This should be your final internship before graduating. To apply, please submit the following: An updated resume / CV - please do so in PDF format. Thoughtful responses to our application questions.
